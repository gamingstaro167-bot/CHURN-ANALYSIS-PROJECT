 Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Google Colab, followed by building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize insights and help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
 Project Objective

Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. The main goals of this project are:

To understand patterns and trends in customer churn.

To identify key drivers influencing churn.

To visualize insights interactively using Power BI.
Tools & Technologies

Google Colab – For running Python code and performing EDA.

Python – With libraries such as:

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Data visualization

Power BI – For creating an interactive dashboard to present churn insights.
 Key Analysis Performed

Distribution of churned vs. retained customers

Analysis of customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen status)

Service usage patterns (e.g., internet service, contract type)

Correlation between tenure, charges, and churn rate

Churn rates by payment method and contract type
Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to allow stakeholders to:

Filter churn data by multiple dimensions

View KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, average tenure

Drill down into churn by geography, services, or customer segments
